The tool is a weapon at same time
Throw it and it will always return as long there still is velocity/power left
It can pick up stuff that is breakable by hand (like no use by tools) and mobs/drops that have 10hp or less.
Players (or mobs that have more then 10 hp) will be hurted.

+ Mese can break more stuff, more times at same throw, and can break stuff like stone / ores, makes a flash when hit something (usefull in darknes / caves)

- Wood cant pick up stuff, hurt less, it fail if it hit hard block.
